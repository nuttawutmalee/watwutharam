// ###Z-index

/* ==========================================================================
   While technically this is just a pure function, but I felt it's worth being on the list as it's so easy to loose track of your z-index values when working in several different files, so we created this so that we could store them in one place for easy editing/recording. Just place this snippet in your main variables/settings.scss file (needs to be imported before any of your other files that reference a x-index of course).
   Then where ever you're wanting to use a z-index value, name it the same as your class and add in it into your variables/setting file, like below. You'll never have a "z-index: 99999999;" headache again.

   .site-header {
       z-index: z('site-header');
   }
   ========================================================================== */
@function z($name) {
  @if index($z-indexes, $name) {
    @return (length($z-indexes) - index($z-indexes, $name)) + 1;
  } @else {
    @warn 'There is no item "#{$name}" in this list; choose one of: #{$z-indexes}';
    @return null;
  }
}

$z-indexes: (
  "outdated-browser",
  "modal",
  "site-header",
  "page-wrapper",
  "site-footer"
);
